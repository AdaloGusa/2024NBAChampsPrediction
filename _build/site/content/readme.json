Although we are only halfway through the season, there is already plenty of data that we can use to determine who will win it all.

True Shooting Percentage is a metric that combines all shooting splits into a tangible percentage. It is calculated through the points scored divided by the total field goal attempts multiplied by 0.44 of the free-through attempts. The equation is listed below.","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1},"end":{"line":85,"column":1}},"key":"vX1N7lUB2i"}],"key":"PZrHmWjsGa"},{"type":"math","identifier":"my-equation","label":"my-equation","value":"True Shooting = Points/(FGA(0.44*FTA))","html":"<span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>G</mi><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0.44</mn><mo>∗</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">True Shooting = Points/(FGA(0.44*FTA))</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">e</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">h</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">oo</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">in</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">g</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">P</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">o</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">in</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">s</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">FG</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">0.44</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">∗</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">FT</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mclose\">))</span></span></span></span></span>","enumerator":"2","html_id":"my-equation","key":"REOCB6grin"},{"type":"embed","position":{"start":{"line":90,"column":1},"end":{"line":90,"column":1}},"source":{"url":"/nbachampprediction","label":"TSP","kind":"Notebook","slug":"nbachampprediction","location":"/NBAChampPrediction.ipynb"},"remove-input":true,"children":[{"type":"output","id":"IgA9_sWhUecvJq7MgMT48","data":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{},"data":{"image/png":{"content_type":"image/png","hash":"7e61a92ac22bc9df4fea47cd42a1a5af","path":"/7e61a92ac22bc9df4fea47cd42a1a5af.png"},"text/plain":{"content":"<Figure size 640x480 with 1 Axes>","content_type":"text/plain"}}}],"key":"fsEVLNd69a"}],"key":"VboD5KDAqc"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":95,"column":1},"end":{"line":95,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Once again each of these teams is extremely close with one another.

Great offensive teams like the Milwaukee Bucks often reveal their weakness when it comes to defense. The Bucks have the highest offensive rating with 120.7, however, they have a defensive rating of 166.9. This is where I believe the Boston Celtics shine the most. They only slightly trail the Bucks in Offensive Rating with 120.3, but they destroy the Bucks in terms of their Defensive Rating of 110.6. In the West, the Minnesota Timberwolves have the best defensive rating in the NBA giving up only 108.5 points a game. Still, the Celtics closely follow with 110.6. The Denver Nuggets have a balanced team of offensive and defensive compared to the other top contenders. The main takeaway of these charts is that the Boston Celtics have both an elite defense and offense, contributing to their extremely high win percentage as the number 1 ranked team in the NBA.","position":{"start":{"line":105,"column":1},"end":{"line":105,"column":1}},"key":"BJQueVjCju"}],"key":"xw8hmc009g"},{"type":"embed","position":{"start":{"line":110,"column":1},"end":{"line":110,"column":1}},"source":{"url":"/nbachampprediction","label":"OFFDEFRTG","kind":"Notebook","slug":"nbachampprediction","location":"/NBAChampPrediction.ipynb"},"remove-input":true,"children":[{"type":"output","id":"viyIXcg5hfq1n5WuWClQQ","data":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{},"data":{"image/png":{"content_type":"image/png","hash":"5d180317d6c54ff5009424c295eebb06","path":"/5d180317d6c54ff5009424c295eebb06.png"},"text/plain":{"content":"<Figure size 640x480 with 1 Axes>","content_type":"text/plain"}}}],"key":"eBaZrC1neD"}],"key":"pU3o2WsRxB"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":115,"column":1},"end":{"line":115,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusion","position":{"start":{"line":115,"column":1},"end":{"line":115,"column":1}},"key":"r5OFYKDx7U"}],"identifier":"conclusion","label":"Conclusion","html_id":"conclusion","implicit":true,"key":"LxZZ00VoS4"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":120,"column":1},"end":{"line":120,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Halfway through the season, I think it is safe to conclude that the Boston Celtics have the highest chance of becoming the 2024 NBA champions.

On top of this, stars like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are hungry for their first title after losing to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 NBA finals. Since this is only halfway through the season, injuries to key players like Jayson Tatum could derail their season.
