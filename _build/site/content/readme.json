Each of the 30 teams battle each other for the chance at an NBA championship title. By the end of the regular season, only the top 8 teams in each conference advance to the playoffs. The goal of this project is to use stats and advanced data from the regular season so far to predict who will win the chip this year. Although we are only halfway through the season, there is already plenty of data that we can use to determine who will win it all. When researching the most important stats that a team needs to win games I used which nba statistics translate to wins by Chinmay Vaidya to determine which stats I would look at  My goal is to continuously update the data as the season goes on so that at the end of the regular season there is a clear champion. This data will not take into account the possibility of injuries that may impact season outcomes.","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"qhlYAuDvOa"}],"key":"lDlAK8nrec"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Background","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"EYFrmnFfgi"}],"identifier":"background","label":"Background","html_id":"background","implicit":true,"key":"n8kZT6MnhE"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To start off analyzing the data, I had to isolate the contending teams.

The Offensive and Defensive ratings stat is one of the most significant stats as it shows how many points the offensive is scoring and how many points the defense is giving up each game.

They are closely followed by the boston celtics with 120.3. The Minesota timberwolves have the best defensive rating with 108.5, and once again the celtics closely follow with 110.6.
