With each year the NBA brings new and exciting basketball content to basketball fans around the world. Each of the 30 teams battle each other for the chance at an NBA championship title. By the end of the regular season, only the top 8 teams in each conference advance to the playoffs. The goal of this project is to use stats and advanced data from the regular season so far to predict who will win the chip this year. Although we are only halfway through the season, there is already plenty of data that we can use to determine who will win it all. When researching the most important stats that a team needs to win games I used which nba statistics translate to wins by CHinmay Vaidya to determine which stats I would look at  My goal is to continuously update the data as the season goes on so that at the end of the regular season there is a clear champion. This data will not take into account the possibility of injuries that may impact season outcomes. 

To start off analyzing the data, I had to isolate the contending teams. Each year the top 8 teams make it to the playoffs. The top 6 ranked teams in each conference automatically make it to the playoffs. However, the 7th-10th ranked teams have to battle it out in the play-in tournament. The results of this decide which 2 teams make became the 7th and 8th seed in the playoffs. Last year the number 10th ranked team the miami heat were able to win their playin game and make it all the way to the NBA finals, so we can never count the play in teams out. 


This data does show how much better the championship contenders are then the play in contenders.Right now the Boston celtics currently have the best win percentage in the NBA winning 76.2 percent of their games so far. After around the top 5 teams the in percentage begins to drop drastically. The worst play in contender team has a win percentage of just 42.9% meaning they have a losing record. 

An interesting way I decided to look at who people think are going to win the NBA title is by looking at betting odds. Using an equation that I found online we can use betting odds to turn into percentages for who NBA fans thnk will win the championship. The equation is listed below.

We can see that the Boston celtics are the overwhelming favorite with 26% of fans believing they will win it all. The celtics are followed by the Denver Nuggets, who were the 2023 NBA champions, with 20%.  The Miuakee bucks are the last obvious pick with 17%. The rest of the teams on this list are still champion contenders. 

Lets return back to actual data obtained from nba.com. The Offensive and Defensive ratings stat is one of the most significant stats as it shows how many points the offensive is scoring and how many points the defense is giving up each game. I isolated 4 championship contenders, 2 from each conference, to compare ratings. We can see that the milwaukee bucks have the highest offensive rating with 120.7. They are closely followed by the boston celtics with 120.3. The Minesota timberwolves have the best defensive rating with 108.5, and once again the celtics closely follow with 110.6. Based on these charts we cna conclude the Boston celtics have a great balance of both offensive and defense that is contributing to their extremely high win percentage as the number 1 ranked team. 

The last factor I am currently looking at is FG%. Certain teams might put up more shots then others, but if their percentages can make or break them. With the same 4 contenders as above we can see that their FG%, 3P%, and FT% are all extremely similar. To determine who has the greatest percentage of shots we can look at True shoooting percentage. The miluake bucks and the Oklahoma city thunder are tied for the highest TS% with 61.5. But like always, the Boston celtics are not far off with their 60.1 TS%.

Halfway through the season  I think it is safe to conclude that the Boston celtics have the highest chance of becoming the 2024 NBA champions. They have the best record, a great mix of players with team chemistry, and advanced stats that are neck and neck with the best team in that category. Since this is only walfway through the season, injuries to stars like Jayson Tatum could derail their season. But, as of now the Celtics only need to continue this level of play and they will win it all this year.

We introduce, a set of open-source, community-driven tools for MyST Markdown ([myst.tools](https://myst.tools)) designed for scientific communication, including a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

## Background

Scientific communication today is designed around print documents and pay-walled access to content. Over the last decade, the open-science movement has accelerated the use of pre-print services and data archives that are vastly improving the accessibility of scientific content. However, these systems are not designed for communicating modern scientific outputs, which encompasses **so much more** than a paper-centric model of the scholarly literature.

> We believe how we share and communicate scientific knowledge should evolve past the status quo of print-based publishing and all the limitations of paper.

The communication and collaboration tools that we are building in the ExecutableBooks project are built to follow the FORCE11 recommendations [](Bourne _et al._, 2012). Specifically:

1. rethink the unit and form of scholarly publication;
2. develop tools and technologies to better support the scholarly lifecycle; and
3. add data, software, and workflows as first-class research objects.

By bringing professional, high-quality tools for science communication into the research lifecycle, we believe we can improve the collection and preservation of scholarly metadata (citations, cross-references, annotations, etc.) as well as open up new ways to communicate science with interactive figures & equations, computation, and reactivity.

The tools that are being built by the ExecutableBooks project are focused on introducing a new Markup language, MyST (Markedly Structured Text), that works seamlessly with the Jupyter community to enhance and promote a new path to document creation and publishing for next-generation scientific textbooks, blogs, and lectures. Our team is currently supported by the [Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org), ([Grant #9231](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/9231)).

MyST enables rich content generation and is a powerful format for scientific and technical communication. JupyterBook uses MyST and has broad adoption in publishing tutorials and educational content focused around Jupyter Notebooks.

> The components behind Jupyter Book are downloaded 30,000 times a day, with 750K downloads last month.

The current toolchain used by [JupyterBook] is based on [Sphinx], which is an open-source documentation system used in many software projects, especially in the Python ecosystem. `mystjs` is a similar tool to [Sphinx], however, designed specifically for scientific communication. In addition to building websites, `mystjs` can also help you create scientific PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, and JATS XML (used in scientific publishing).

`mystjs` uses existing, modern web-frameworks in place of the [Sphinx] build system. These tools come out-of-the-box with prefetching for faster navigation, smaller network payloads through modern web-bundlers, image optimization, partial-page refresh through single-page application. Many of these features, performance and accessibility improvements are difficult, if not impossible, to create inside of the [Sphinx] build system.

In 2022, the Executable Books team started work to document the specification behind the markup language, called [myst-spec](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-spec), this work has enabled other tools and implementations in the scientific ecosystem to build on MyST (e.g. [scientific authoring tools](https://curvenote.com/for/writing), and [documentation systems](https://blog.readthedocs.com/jupyter-book-read-the-docs/)).

The `mystjs` ecosystem was developed as a collaboration between [Curvenote], [2i2c] and the [ExecutableBooks] team. The initial version of `mystjs` was originally release by [Curvenote] as the [Curvenote CLI](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli) under the MIT license, and transferred to the [ExecutableBooks] team in October 2022. The goal of the project is to enable the same rich content and authoring experiences that [Sphinx] allows for software documentation, with a focus on web-first technologies (Javascript), interactivity, accessibility, scientific references (e.g. DOIs and other persistent IDs), professional PDF outputs, and JATS XML documents for scientific archiving.

## MyST Project

In this paper we introduce `mystjs`, which allows the popular MyST Markdown syntax to be run directly in a web browser, opening up new workflows for components to be used in web-based editors, [directly in Jupyter](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst) and in JupyterLite. The libraries work with current MyST Markdown documents/projects and can export to [LaTeX/PDF](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/creating-pdf-documents), [Microsoft Word](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/creating-word-documents) and [JATS](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/creating-jats-xml) as well as multiple website templates using a [modern](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/accessibility-and-performance) React-based renderer. There are currently over 400 scientific journals that are supported through [templates](https://github.com/myst-templates), with [new LaTeX templates](https://myst.tools/docs/jtex/create-a-latex-template) that can be added easily using a Jinja-based templating package, called [jtex](https://myst.tools/docs/jtex).

In our paper we will give an overview of the MyST ecosystem, how to use MyST tools in conjunction with existing Jupyter Notebooks, markdown documents, and JupyterBooks to create professional PDFs and interactive websites, books, blogs and scientific articles. We give special attention to the additions around structured data, standards in publishing (e.g. efforts in representing Notebooks as JATS XML), rich [frontmatter](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/frontmatter) and bringing [cross-references](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/cross-references) and [persistent IDs](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/external-references) to life with interactive hover-tooltips ([ORCID, RoR](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/frontmatter), [RRIDs](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/external-references#research-resource-identifiers), [DOIs](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/citations), [intersphinx](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/external-references#intersphinx), [wikipedia](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/external-references#wikipedia-links), [JATS](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/typography), [GitHub code](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/external-references#github-links), and more!). This rich metadata and structured content can be used directly to improve science communication both through self-publishing books, blogs, and lab websites â€” as well as journals that incorporate Jupyter Notebooks.

## Features of MyST

MyST is focused on scientific writing, and ensuring that citations are first class both for writing and for reading (see Figure 1).

![](./images/citations.png)
**Figure 1**: Citations are rendered with a popup directly inline.

MyST aims to show as much information in context as possible, for example, Figure 2 shows a reading experience for a referenced equation: you can immediately **click on the reference**, see the equation, all without loosing any context -- ultimately saving you time. Head _et al._ (2021) found that these ideas both improved the overall reading experience of articles as well as allowed researchers to answer questions about an article **26% faster** when compared to a traditional PDF!

**Figure 2**: In context cross-references improve the reading experience.

One of the important underlying goals of practicing reproducibility, sharing more of the methods and data behind a scientific work so that other researchers can both verify as well as build upon your findings. One of the exciting ways to pull for reproducibility is to make documents directly linked to data and computation! In Figure 3, we are showing outputs from a Jupyter Notebook directly part of the published scientific narrative.

To drive all of these features, the contents of a MyST document needs to be well defined. This is critical for powering interactive hovers, linked citations, and compatibility with scientific publishing standards like the Journal Article Metadata Tag Suite (JATS). We have an emerging specification for MyST, [`myst-spec`](https://spec.myst.tools), that aims to capture this information and transform it between many different formats, like PDF, Word, JSON, and JATS XML (Figure 4). This specification is arrived at through a community-centric MyST Enhancement Proposal ([MEP](https://compass.executablebooks.org/en/latest/meps.html)) process.

![](./images/structured-data.gif)
**Figure 4**: The data behind MyST is **structured**, which means we can transform it into many different document types and use it to power all sorts of exciting features!

One of the common forms of scientific communication today is through PDF documents. MyST has excellent support for creating PDF documents, using a data-driven templating library called `jtex`. The document in Figure 5 was created using MyST!

## Conclusion

There are many opportunities to improve open-science communication, to make it more interactive, accessible, more reproducible, and both produce and use structured data throughout the research-writing process. The `mystjs` ecosystem of tools is designed with structured data at its core. We would love if you gave it a try -- learn to get started at <https://myst.tools>.
